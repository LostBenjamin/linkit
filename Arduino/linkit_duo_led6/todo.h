// fast blink, breathe
// static, flame
// invert hue, swing hue, back and forth between two arbitrary colors, rgb cube
// rainbow colors incremental, or continuously changing
// shooting up
// fade based on build time
// change refresh rate based on time of day (afterhours it doesn't need to check that often)
// show something if the data hasn't updated in a long time
// show something if the data has been unchanged for some time, like after hours
// after pause, allow breathing and blinking to come to a halt first
// rotation
// transitions
// copy -- everything up to black is copied on top of black
// stop sign timing and opposite timing
// reverse, inverse mirror
// brief flash, or something, to alert to a new (green?) build
// some way to visually tell which are changes from a little while ago (like the fading yellow highlight on web pages)
// demo - do random stuff
// full frame animation in/out using back buffer
// restrict flood, etc. to window
// wipe = canned pshifto 0,anim num leds
// would be nice to shift-in the new pixels from the back buffer
// efade is broken
// be able to reverse shift/animation direction
// screen saver
// audo brightness, set brightness
