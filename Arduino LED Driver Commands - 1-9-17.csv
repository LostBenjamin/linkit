,cfade,cfa,,Render the display with a smooth crossfade dissolve,Allows a nice transition between displays,pause:blue:flood:flush:red:flood:cfade:continue,"be sure to pause first before using the crossfade transition!

for a smooth transition, the R, G or B values should not exceed the byte value ""179"" and the brightness level should not exceed 70%. If exceeded, the byte values will roll over and cause highly visible flashing.

when the brightness percentage is low, such as 5%, the crossfade may not be smooth due to floating value truncation",
